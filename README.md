Tech Fest 1.0 - AI Hackathon

It is the first module of the Hackathon, where you build a Emotional Fluctuations Predictor.

You will need to clean and preprocess the dataset, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationships between features and build a model to classify emotional fluctuations. This comprehensive process will challenge your ability to handle data, extract meaningful insights, and develop robust predictive models.

Evaluation

You are provided with two CSV files.

1- Train.csv

2- Test.csv

You have to create a model using Train.csv. Then run the model on Test.csv.
Test.csv has an ID column that will be used to map the results from the ground truth.

Evaluation will be done on the Accuracy Score of your model.

You have to submit a CSV file with the format.
